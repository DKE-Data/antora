== Upgrade checklist

You may need to make some of the following changes to your documentation system before using Antora 2.0.

Does Antora access private repositories in order to build your site?::
If yes, you'll need to say goodbye to your SSH agent and set up your authentication credentials for each private repository URL in a git credential store.
Refer to the xref:playbook:private-repository-auth.adoc[Private repository authentication] documentation for setup options and instructions.

Is your Antora playbook file written in CSON?::
If yes, you'll need to migrate it to YAML, JSON, or TOML before running Antora 2.0.

If you answered *No* to all of the above questions, then you're ready to upgrade to Antora 2.0 now!
ifeval::["{route}" == "New"]
See xref:install:upgrade-antora.adoc[Upgrade Antora] for instructions.

NOTE: Antora 1.1 will enter maintenance on March 25, 2019.
See the xref:ROOT:project/release-schedule.adoc[Release schedule] for details.
