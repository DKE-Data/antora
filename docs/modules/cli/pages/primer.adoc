= CLI Primer

If you aren't familiar with command line interfaces, the following sections provide a basic overview of command line functions and the terminal concepts used in this documentation.

[#function-inputs]
== Function inputs and structure

The Antora CLI accepts function inputs in the form of commands, options, environment variables, and positional arguments.
Once entered in a terminal, the function is executed using the specified inputs.

 $ antora <command> [options and environment variables] <arguments>

antora:: All functions start with the xref:index.adoc#cli-commands[base command antora].
This required command calls and runs Antora.

command:: A xref:index.adoc#cli-commands[command] tells Antora what operation to perform.
A function can include more than one command.

option:: One or more xref:options.adoc[options] can be specified after a command.
The full name of an option is prefixed with two hyphens (`--`); a shorthand name is prefixed with one hyphen (`-`).
+
Some options toggle behavior on or off and others accept values.
Options that accept values can be written using a single space between the option's name and value (`--option value`) or using an equals sign between the name and value (`--option=value`).

environment variable:: xref:playbook:environment-variables.adoc[Environment variables] are read from your terminal's state unless a variable is explicitly specified in a function.
An environment variable passed from the CLI overrides the corresponding variable set in the terminal's state and corresponding key set in the playbook.

argument:: An argument, such as the name of the xref:index.adoc#specify-playbook[required playbook file], is entered last in the function.

[#terminal-conventions]
== Terminal conventions

If you're new to terminal applications, here are the common conventions used in this documentation that represent a terminal and describe how you'll interact with it.

Prompt (`$`)::
The terminal command prompt is shown as a dollar sign (`$`) in the examples throughout this documentation.
The prompt you see when you open your terminal depends on the terminal application you use.
Don't include the `$` prompt when you type or copy functions.

[[working-directory]]Working directory::
+
--
Every function is run from a current working directory.
The processes associated with a function's inputs are interpreted relative to the working directory.
Your current working directory is often displayed directly to the left of the terminal's command prompt (`$`), however, this is dependent on the terminal application you're using and how its configured.

A few examples in this documentation show the name of the working directory in front of the prompt as a helpful hint.

 name-of-working-directory $ antora antora-playbook

Don't include this text or the prompt when copying the functions.
--

Replaceable input::
Many options are defined according to your content, environment, and site requirements.
Some command line examples in this documentation call out the input you define with a set of angle brackets (`< >`).
The text inside the brackets describes the input or represents a common input format, e.g., `--require <path/to/library-script>`, `--title '<Title of Your Site>'`.
When composing the function in your terminal, replace the representative text with your input and don't enclose it in angle brackets (`< >`).

Command output::
If a command returns information, the output is displayed in your terminal on the lines beneath the executed command.
The command prompt (`$`) is not displayed on the output lines.
