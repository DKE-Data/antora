When Antora runs, it performs the following steps:

. Clones (or pulls) the content repositories using git via NodeGit.
. Resolves and downloads the UI bundle using the GitHub API (unless it's already cached).
. Locates and reads all AsciiDoc files.
. Locates and reads all navigation files.
. Converts AsciiDoc files to embeddable HTML.
. Wraps the embeddable HTML in the page template and adds the navigation tree, which is also converted to HTML.
. Reads asset files (images, attachments, and UI resources).
. Writes all site files to [.path]_build/site_.

//The following sections describe a few of these steps in more detail.
