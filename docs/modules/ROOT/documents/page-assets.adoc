[#insert-attachment]
== Insert an attachment

An attachment is a resource that you want your user to download, such as a PDF or a ZIP archive of a sample project.
To insert a link to an attachment for download, use the AsciiDoc link macro (`link:[]`).

.Insert a link to an attachment
[source,asciidoc]
----
link:{attachmentsdir}/example.raml[Download the RAML example] and run it.
----

To insert a link to an attachment, use the link macro prefix, followed by the `{attachmentsdir}` reference, then the name of the file, and then a set of square brackets (`[]`).
Optional link text can be entered between the brackets.

You don't need to set the path to the [.path]_attachments/_ directory in the header of your file.
This is managed automatically by Antora and the [.path]_attributes.adoc_ file stored in each module.

A module's image files should be saved in its xref:module.adoc#attachments-dir[attachments folder].

[#insert-image]
== Insert an image

To insert an image on its own line, use the AsciiDoc block image macro (`image::[]`).

.Insert a block image
[source,asciidoc]
----
image::file-name.ext[optional alt text]
----

To insert an image, use the image macro prefix, then the name of the file, followed by a set of square brackets (`[]`).
You can enter alt text for the image between the square brackets.

.Image macro example
[source,asciidoc]
----
image::pipeline-workflow.png[a diagram illustrating the pipeline stages]
----

A module's image files should be saved in its xref:module.adoc#images-dir[images folder].
// inline image info needed

[#insert-video]
== Insert a video

You can embed self-hosted videos or videos shared on YouTube and Vimeo.

Video format support is dictated by the user's browser and/or system.
For a list of the web video formats each browser supports, see the {uri-video-formats}[Mozilla Developer Supported Media Formats documentation].

TIP: Insert animated GIFs with the <<insert-image,image macro>>.

.Insert a self-hosted video
----
video::video-file.mp4[]
----

To insert a self-hosted video, use the video macro prefix, then the name of the file, followed by a set of square brackets (`[]`).
A module's video files should be saved in its xref:module.adoc#videos-dir[videos folder].

=== Externally hosted videos

To embed a video hosted on Youtube or Vimeo, put the video's ID in the macro target and the name of the hosting service (`youtube`, `vimeo`) between the brackets.

.Embed a Youtube video
----
video::rPQoq7ThGAU[youtube]
