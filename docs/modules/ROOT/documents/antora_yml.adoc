When we find an [.path]_antora.yml_ file in a repository, we expect to find the standard structure of a documentation component below it.
Thus, the documentation can live anywhere in the repository.
It also means it can share the same repository as the software it documents.
This project structure is then repeated in each branch of each repository that hosts a documentation component.

The [.path]_antora.yml_ file contains information about the component, such as its name, title, version, and navigation data.

[source,yml]
----
name: component-a
title: Component A
version: '1.0'
nav:
- modules/admin/nav.adoc
----

All the other files in the component reside in the [.path]_modules_ folder.
Let's open that folder and have a look inside.
