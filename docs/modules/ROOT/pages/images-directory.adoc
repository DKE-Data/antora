Antora applies preset behavior to the source files stored in an [.path]_images_ directory when it generates a site.

[#images]
== Images

[.term]*Images* are source files, such as photographs, diagrams, and screenshots, that are saved in an [.path]_images_ family directory.

Images can be inserted into any page or partial, regardless of the module or component version it belongs to, using the xref:asciidoc:insert-image.adoc[block or inline image macros].
AsciiDoc supports PNG, JPG, SVG, and GIF (static and animated) image file formats.
If an image isn't referenced in an AsciiDoc image macro, its content won't be published to a site.

NOTE: When referencing an image, you don't need to include the `image` family name in its resource ID.
Antora automatically applies it to a target resource ID in an AsciiDoc image macro.
