Antora runs on well-known Linux distributions, macOS, and Windows.
Thanks to this broad platform support, Antora can be used with most continuous integration environments and cloud platforms.

This page provides an <<platforms,overview of the platforms>> Antora supports and directs you to the <<what-s-next,system requirements>> for each platform.
The Antora project also provides an official xref:antora-container.adoc[Docker container] you can use to bypass the installation process.

== Platforms

Antora is actively tested on the platforms listed below.

// When we have specific notes about a platform (tweaks and/or links to bugs) add a 3rd column to this table labeled "Good to Know"

While we only continuously test Antora on Fedora, Alpine Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu, we anticipate it should operate as expected on most well-known Linux distributions.

.About the Antora Test Suite
****
At last count, Antora had {test-count} tests that coverage over {test-coverage} of the lines.
We add more tests every week.
We're just a teeny bit obsessed with writing high quality tests and achieving complete test coverage.

== Cloud platforms

Antora should operate as designed on common cloud platforms.
How you provision your cloud instance depends on your workload requirements and remote git repository sizes.
If you're running Antora on a cloud platform, we would love to hear about your experience (open a {url-issues}[new issue^] or join us in the {url-chat-dev}[development channel^]).

////
== Virtual Machine (VM) environments

Antora runs in VirtualBox and should operate as designed in common VM environments such as VMware.
If you're running Antora in a VM environment, we would love to hear about your experience (open a {url-issues}[new issue^] or join us in the {url-chat-dev}[development channel^]).
////

== Hardware recommendations

Your hardware requirements will depend primarily on the size of the remote git repositories your Antora pipeline fetches content from when it is generating your site.

The first time Antora runs, it fetches and clones all of the remote git repositories specified in a playbook.
The speed of this operation is dictated by the size of the remote repositories, environment input/output parameters, and network performance.
After the initial run, Antora caches the repositories locally.
On subsequent runs, Antora only reconnects to the remote repositories if the xref:playbook:configure-runtime.adoc#pull[pull option] is enabled or the xref:playbook:configure-runtime.adoc#cache[cache folder] is removed.

|RAM
|Memory requirements depend on the size of your Git repositories.
3GB should provide performance headroom.

|I/O
|Maximum throughput and minimum latency always make things nicer but aren't required.
