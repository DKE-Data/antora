* [x] How Antora handles pages.
// * [x] Full explanation of a page, including its purpose, types, structure, and behaviors.

Antora generates site pages from AsciiDoc files.
AsciiDoc files are text files marked up with the AsciiDoc syntax and saved with the file extension `.adoc`.

How Antora processes an AsciiDoc file depends on where it is stored in a documentation component.
There are three ways to assemble the content of an individual page: standard, quantum, and disco.

NOTE: Hey, these names are arbitrary, so we decided to have a little fun.

== Standard page

Antora generates a site page from an AsciiDoc file.
All of the AsciiDoc files (`.adoc`) located in the [.path]_pages_ directory of a module are converted to individual HTML pages automatically.
