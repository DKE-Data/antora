The Antora project provides a Docker image so you can run the `antora` command inside a container (a process known as [.term]_containerization_).
The benefit of this approach is that you can bypass installation of Antora and skip right to running it.
All you need is Docker.

Assumptions:

* [x] You have {url-docker}[Docker] (command: `docker`) installed on your machine.
* [x] The Docker daemon is running on your machine.
* [x] You have configured your own xref:playbook:playbook.adoc[playbook] or you're using the Demo playbook.

On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to run Antora inside a container using the official Docker image for Antora.
* [x] How to give the container access to a local directory.
* [x] How to extend the Docker image for Antora to create your own image.

== Docker image for Antora

{url-docker}[Docker] is a tool for running container images.
You can think of a container image as an application in a box.
Inside that box is everything you need to run the application, including the code, the runtime, the settings, and even the operating system itself.
Containers not only isolate software from the host environment, they also make it easy to get up and running quickly.
And that's a perfect way to discover and explore Antora!

The Antora project provides an official Docker image named `antora/antora` for running Antora inside a container.
This image is published to {url-docker-hub}[Docker Hub].

This image is a drop-in replacement for the `antora` command.
Rather than installing the `antora` command on your own computer or in a CI environment, you simply run the command by running the container.
In fact, the {url-docs-job}[CI job for the Antora documentation site] uses this image to generate the documentation you're currently reading.

Let's find out how to run it.

== Run the Antora image

To demonstrate how to use this image, weâ€™ll be using the Antora demo site.
Start by cloning the the playbook repository for the demo site and switching to the cloned folder:

 ~ $ git clone https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-site.git && cd demo-site

Next, execute the `docker run` command to run this image directly.

 demo-site $ docker run --privileged -v `pwd`:/antora --rm antora/antora site.yml

NOTE: The `--privileged` option is only required if you're running a Linux distribution that has SELinux enabled by default, such as Fedora.
This option allows you to use volume mounts under SELinux.

This command spins up a new container from the image, mounts the current directory to the path [.path]_/antora_ inside the container, runs the `antora` command, then stops and removes the container.
It's exactly as though you ran a locally-installed `antora` command, only you used container superpowers to do it.

== Enter the container

If you want to shell into the container instead of having it run the `antora` command, set the `--entrypoint` option as follows:

 demo-site $ docker run --entrypoint ash --privileged -v `pwd`:/antora --rm -it antora/antora

Now you can run the `antora` command from anywhere inside the running container.
This mode is useful to use while editing.
Since the container continues to run, you can quickly execute the `antora` command.

If the base Antora image doesn't include everything you need for your site, you can extend it.

== Extend the Antora image

You can use this image as a base for your own Docker image.
The image comes preconfigured with Yarn so you can install additional extensions, such as {url-plantuml-npm}[Asciidoctor PlantUML] (`asciidoctor-plantuml`).

. Clone the docker-antora repository and switch to it:

 ~ $ git clone https://gitlab.com/antora/docker-antora.git && cd docker-antora

. Create a custom Dockerfile file named [.path]_Dockerfile.custom_.
. Populate the file with the following contents:
+
.Dockerfile.custom
[source,docker]
----
FROM antora/antora

RUN yarn global add asciidoctor-plantuml # <1>
----
<1> Adds a custom extension to the base image.

. Build the image using the following command:

 docker-antora $ docker build -t local/antora:custom -f Dockerfile.custom .

Once the build is finished, you'll have a new image available on your machine named `local/antora:custom`.
To see a list of all your images, run the following command:

 $ docker images

To run this image, switch back to your playbook project and run the container as follows:

 demo-site $ docker run --privileged -v `pwd`:/antora --rm local/antora:custom site.yml

If you want to share this image with others, you'll need to publish it.
Consult the {url-docker}[Docker documentation] to find out how.
