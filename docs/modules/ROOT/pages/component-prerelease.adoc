= Label a Prerelease Version

Informs Antora that the component version is a prerelease version.
Antora applies alternate sorting and routing rules to component versions designated as prereleases.
Key can be used to append a prerelease label (e.g., Beta, -alpha.2) to the value of `version` without affecting the version coordinate or version URL segment.

[#prerelease-key]
== prerelease key

The `prerelease` key is a marker that this version is considered prerelease.
xref:component-versions.adoc#prerelease-versions[Prerelease versions] are skipped when selecting the xref:component-versions.adoc#latest-version[latest version of a component] (unless all versions are prereleases, in which case the normal rules apply).

```yaml
prerelease: true
```

The `prerelease` key is not set by default.
