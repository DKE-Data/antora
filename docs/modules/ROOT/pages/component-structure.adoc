//:page-alias: component-structure.adoc

Antora uses content organized into documentation components when it generates a documentation site.
A site can have many documentation components or a single documentation component.

== What is a documentation component?

A [.term]_documentation component_ typically represents the documentation for a product, application, project, microservice, or even a training or college course.
It's a collection of files grouped into modules and families that share common metadata.
Antora extracts a documentation component's metadata from its component descriptor file ([.path]_antora.yml_) and the standardized directory structure used to store the component's source files.

[#overview]
== Standard directory structure of a documentation component

The source files of a documentation component are organized into a standard directory structure.
Antora uses this structure to automatically assign preset behavior and metadata to the files stored in each directory.
The figure below shows an example of this standard directory structure.

At a minimum, a documentation component must contain a component descriptor file ([.path]_antora.yml_), a [.path]_modules_ directory, one module directory, such as [.path]_ROOT_ or a name you choose ([.path]_name-of-module_), and one family directory ([.path]_attachments_, [.path]_examples_, [.path]_images_, [.path]_pages_, or [.path]_partials_).

=== _antora.yml_ file

The component descriptor file tells Antora that the contents of the repository or directory are a documentation component.
This file contains crucial metadata, assigned by key-value pairs, that are applied to all of a component's files.
See xref:component-descriptor.adoc[Component Descriptor: antora.yml] to learn more about the required and optional information you can assign to a component.

=== _modules_ directory

Except for [.path]_antora.yml_, all of a component's source files must reside in the [.path]_modules_ directory.
This directory helps Antora locate the documentation component when it is stored in a repository or directory with other files, such as an application's source code.

=== Named and ROOT module directories

The [.path]_modules_ directory can contain a single module directory or as many module directories as you require.
A module directory represents a module in that documentation component.
A xref:modules.adoc[module] is a discrete bundle of content, such as text, images, and other source materials, that is usually related by concept, stage, feature, or audience.
The directory name of a module ([.path]_name-of-module_) is used as the module coordinate in a resource ID and, with the exception of the special `ROOT` module, appears in the site's output path.

The xref:modules.adoc#root[_ROOT_ directory is a special module directory].
Its name doesn't appear in the site's output path.
Instead, it becomes the parent of any named modules in that component.

=== Family directories

Each module directory, whether [.path]_ROOT_ or a named module ([.path]_name-of-module_), can contain any of the following family directories:

* xref:modules.adoc#attachments-dir[_attachments_]
* xref:modules.adoc#examples-dir[_examples_]
* xref:modules.adoc#images-dir[_images_]
* xref:modules.adoc#pages-dir[_pages_]
* xref:modules.adoc#partials-dir[_partials_]

Antora automatically assigns preset behavior to the files in these directories.
For example, AsciiDoc files in [.path]_name-of-module/pages_ are automatically converted to standalone HTML pages.

=== Navigation file

A module can contain none, one, or more navigation files.
A xref:navigation:filenames-and-locations.adoc[navigation file] is an AsciiDoc file ([.path]_nav.adoc_) that is stored in the directory of the module, but not in any of the module's family directories.
In order to be displayed in the xref:navigation:index.adoc[component's navigation menu], a module's navigation file must be xref:navigation:register-navigation-files.adoc[declared in the component descriptor] .

//TIP: Did you know that a component's files can be sourced from multiple repositories?
//That means a module's examples directory can be stored in one repository and its pages in another or several repositories.
//This capability is provided by the simple but-oh-so-powerful component descriptor file, [.path]_antora.yml_.
