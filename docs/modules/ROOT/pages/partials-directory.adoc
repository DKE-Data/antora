Antora applies preset behavior to the source files stored in the [.path]_partials_ directory when it generates a site.

[#partials]
== Partials

[.term]*Partials* are usually AsciiDoc source files (_.adoc_) that contain content snippets, such as common descriptions, terminology, or reference tables, that you plan to insert in multiple pages.
They may also be reusable UML, STEM, or CSV/TSV content.
The source files for partials are stored in a [.path]_partials_ directory.

If a partial isn't referenced in an AsciiDoc include directive, its content won't be published to a site (unlike xref:pages-directory.adoc#pages[pages], which are always automatically published).
Partials and tagged regions in a partial can be inserted into any page, regardless of the module or component version that page belongs to, using the xref:asciidoc:include-partial.adoc[include directive and the partial's resource ID].

When referencing a partial, the `partial` family name must be included in its resource ID.
The family name, `partial`, is required because the include directive is also used to reference xref:examples-directory.adoc[example source files].
