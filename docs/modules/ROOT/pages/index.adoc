IMPORTANT: Antora {version} is now available!

Antora is an end-to-end solution.
It collects source content and outputs a complete site.
No additional scripts are needed.
This orchestration makes the Antora pipeline extremely CI-friendly.
All the CI job has to worry about is preparing the environment and launching a single command.

== Docs and configuration as code

An Antora pipeline has a modular architecture.
It consists of a playbook project, content repositories, a UI bundle, and Antora's pipeline packages, all of which are discrete parts.
The playbook project drives Antora and your documentation site generation.

The separation of these parts keeps the logic and configuration separate from the content.
The content repositories are just content.
They can be enlisted, per branch, into the site generation process.
This strategy makes it possible for content branches to be reused, substituted, deactivated, or archived.
This is a sharp contrast to many other site generators, which intermix all these concerns, making the documentation difficult to manage, maintain, and enhance.

Let's go over how to xref:component-structure.adoc[organize your documentation] so Antora can use it.
We'll also show you how install Node 8 on xref:install/linux-requirements.adoc[Linux], xref:install/windows-requirements.adoc[Windows], or xref:install/macos-requirements.adoc[macOS] and xref:install/install-antora.adoc[install Antora]. Finally, we'll xref:run-antora-generate-site.adoc[run Antora] and publish a documentation site using a xref:playbook:index.adoc[playbook].
