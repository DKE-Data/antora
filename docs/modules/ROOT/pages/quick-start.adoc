Assumptions:

* [x] You know what Antora was designed for and how it works

This guide walks you through the steps required to install Antora and generate the first site in a quick and straightforward manner.

On this page, youâ€™ll learn:

* [x] How to install the tools you need in order to install and run Antora.
* [x] How to install the Antora CLI and the default Antora site generator.
* [x] How to create your first playbook (a configuration file for Antora).
* [x] How to run Antora and generate a site using the playbook.

== Install the tools

This includes base build tools for your Linux distribution and Node.

First, install base build tools. Open a terminal and type the command associated with your Linux distribution:

* Fedora: `dnf install @development-tools`
* Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install build-essential libcurl3-gnutls libssl-dev`
* Arch Linux: `pacman -S base-devel`
* Alpine Linux: `apk add g++ libressl-dev make python curl-dev`
* RHEL: `yum install gcc-c++ make openssl-devel libcurl-devel hostname`

Next, make sure you have Node installed - no less than version 8.0.0. To check this, run the following command:

  $ node --version

If yes, proceed to the next step. If no, or if this command returned an error, you need to install Node. The best way to do it is to use <<install-nvm,nvm>>.

Use the install script for nvm installation:

  $ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

Install the latest Node 9.x version (that is supported at this moment) and set it as default:

  $ nvm install 9.11.2
  $ nvm use 9.11.2
  $ nvm alias default 9.11.2

Once you've installed the base build tools and Node, it's time to install Antora.

NOTE: The detailed information about supported platforms and installation requirements is available xref:supported-platforms.adoc[here].

== Install Antora

Before installing Antora, make a new directory for your site named [.path]_antora_ and switch to it.

  $ mkdir antora
  $ cd antora

To generate documentation sites with Antora, you need the Antora command line interface (CLI) and an Antora site generator pipeline. We will install both packages together:

  $ npm i --save-dev @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default

After that you can run Antora command by typing `./node_modules/.bin/antora` which is not very convenient. To launch `antora` command directly, add `./node_modules/.bin` to PATH.

  export PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH
  
Verify the `antora` command is now available on your PATH by running:

  $ antora -v

If the installation was successful, the command should report the version of Antora.  

Once you've installed the Antora CLI and the default site generator, you are ready to create your first playbook.

NOTE: The detailed information about installation procedure is available xref:install/install-antora.adoc[here].

== Create a Playbook

To produce a documentation site, Antora needs a playbook. Using your preferred text editor or IDE, create a new playbook file named `site.yml` and populate it with the following demo contents:

.site.yml
[source,yaml]
----
site:
  title: Antora Docs
  start_page: component-b::index.adoc # <1>
content:
  sources: # <2>
  - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git 
    branches: master
  - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git
    branches: [v2.0, v1.0]
    start_path: docs
ui: # <3>
  bundle:
    url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable
    snapshot: true
----
<1> A page from a documentation component to be used as the index page for your site. 
<2> The sources key contains the list of git repository locations, branch name patterns, and other repository properties that Antora uses when aggregating the site content.
<3> The `ui` category contains keys that specify the location of the UI bundle and how it should be processed.

Save the playbook as `site.yml` in the `antora` directory you made in the previous step.

NOTE: The detailed information about playbook configuration schema is available xref:playbook:playbook-schema.adoc[here].

== Run Antora

To generate the site, run `antora` command specifying the path to your playbook file:

  $ antora site.yml

Antora will clone the content repository.

[TIP]
====
If you want to see the cloning progress of each repository in the terminal, run `antora` with the `--pull` xref:cli:index.adoc#_commands_and_options[option]:

  $ antora site.yml --pull

.Repository cloning progress
....
[clone] https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git [################]
[clone] https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git [################]
....
====

Navigate to the [.path]_build/site_ destination directory and open _index.html_ file in your browser.

Congratulations! You've successfully built your first site with Antora.

NOTE: The detailed information about running Antora is available xref:run-antora.adoc[here].
