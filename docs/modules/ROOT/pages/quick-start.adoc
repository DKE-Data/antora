Assumptions:

* [x] You know what Antora was designed for and how it works

This guide walks you through the steps required to install Antora and generate the first site in a quick and straightforward manner.

On this page, youâ€™ll learn:

* [x] How to install the tools you need in order to install and run Antora.
* [x] How to install the Antora CLI and the default Antora site generator.
* [x] How to create your first playbook (a configuration file for Antora).
* [x] How to run Antora and generate a site using the playbook.

== Install the tools

This includes base build tools for your Linux distribution and Node.

First, open a terminal and type:

  $ apt install build-essential libcurl3-gnutls libssl-dev

Next, make sure you have Node version no less than 8.0.0:

  $ node --version

If yes, proceed to the next step. If no or if this command returned an error, you need to install Node. The best way to do it is to use <<install-nvm,nvm>>.

Use the install script for nvm installation:

  $ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

Install the latest Node 9.x version (that is supported at this moment) and set it as default:

  $ nvm install 9.11.2
  $ nvm use 9.11.2
  $ nvm alias default 9.11.2

Once you've installed the base build tools and Node, it's time to install Antora.

NOTE: The detailed information about supported platforms and installation requirements is available xref:supported-platforms.adoc[here].

== Install Antora

To generate documentation sites with Antora, you need the Antora command line interface (CLI) and an Antora site generator pipeline.

First, install the Antora CLI:

  $ npm i -g @antora/cli

Verify the `antora` command is available on your PATH by running:

 $ antora -v

If the installation was successful, the command should report the version of Antora.  

Before installing the default site generator, make a new directory for your site named [.path]_antora_ and switch to it.

  $ mkdir antora
  $ cd antora

Install the default site generator in the directory:

  $ npm install @antora/site-generator-default

Once you've installed the Antora CLI and the default site generator, you are ready to create your first playbook.

NOTE: The detailed information about installation procedure is available xref:install/install-antora.adoc[here].

== Create a Playbook

To produce a documentation site, Antora needs a playbook. Using your preferred text editor or IDE, create a new playbook file named `site.yml` and populate it with the following demo contents:

.site.yml
[source,yaml]
----
site:
  title: Antora Docs
  start_page: component-b::index.adoc
content:
  sources:
  - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git
    branches: master
  - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git
    branches: [v2.0, v1.0]
    start_path: docs
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable
    snapshot: true
----

Save the playbook as `site.yml` in the `antora` directory you made in the previous step.

NOTE: The detailed information about playbook configuration schema is available xref:playbook:playbook-schema.adoc[here].

== Run Antora

To generate the site, simply point the `antora` command at your playbook file.

In your terminal, type:

  $ antora site.yml

Antora will clone the content repository. The cloning progress of each repository is displayed in the terminal.

.Repository cloning progress
....
[clone] https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git [################]
[clone] https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git [################]
....

Navigate to the [.path]_build/site_ destination directory and open _index.html_ file in your browser.

Congratulations! You've successfully built your first site with Antora.

NOTE: The detailed information about running Antora is available xref:run-antora.adoc[here].
