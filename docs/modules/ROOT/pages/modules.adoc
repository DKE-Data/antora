= Modules

== What is a module?

A documentation component is composed of one or more modules.
A [.term]_module_ is a discrete bundle of content, including text, images, and other source materials, organized in a hierarchy of folders by content type, then by optional topic (aka tag or category) if needed.

=== Why modules?

You might be contemplating one or more of the following questions:

[%hardbreaks]
Why have modules?
Do we need all this structure?
Isn't a component enough?

One thing we've learned about documentation is that it multiplies, often quickly and unpredictably.
As more content is created and your documentation team grows, more often than not, you want to start grouping files into folders to make them easier to find and manage.
Modules allow you to group text files and their associated assets together as your documentation expands, all while preserving the xref:page:page-id.adoc#important[full capability of Antora's page ID].

Modules are also perfect when one software project is incubating a potential subproject that may spin off as its own project in the future.
It's easy to later detach a module from a component and set it up as its own documentation component.

// This section feels rather unhelpful/hand-wavy, a nice solid example will probably help structure it better but such an example is going to take time (i.e. needs to be its own issue)
// Eventually, we'll want to put together a little "Should I make this a topic folder or a module?" and/or what are some examples of topics vs modules.

//Modules are also useful for grouping all the content related to a feature that you'll retire in a few versions.

== Module overview

A documentation component can contain as many modules as you need or as few as one.
If you only create one module in a component, we highly recommend that you name it _ROOT_ because Antora automatically applies component-level URLs to the files in this module.
The following figure illustrates a documentation component with a few example folders and files added for context.
All of a component's modules must be stored in [.path]_modules_.

image::module-dir-structure.png[alt="Directory structure of a component containing two modules. The ROOT module contains all of the optional family subdirectories with a sample file type in each folder for context.",width="200"]

Let's examine the role of the _ROOT_ module and the requirements of the subdirectories a module can contain.

[#root-dir]
== ROOT module

The [.term]_ROOT_ module contains all the content that's directly associated with the documentation component itself.

image::root-dir-structure.png[alt="Directory structure of the ROOT module that uses the subdirectories named attachments, examples, images, pages, and partials.",width="165"]

When the pages in the ROOT module are published, these pages are promoted a level above any other modules`' pages in that component's URL.
(You can see an example of a ROOT page's URL in <<pages-dir,pages>>.)
The directory name, ROOT, must be entered in all uppercase letters.
When used in a page or resource reference, it must be entered in all uppercase letters.

Small documentation components may never need more than a ROOT module.
However, if your project grows, you can easily add more modules and gradually redistribute the content without having to restructure the project.
So while the extra structure seems like overkill now, in the long run, you'll be glad you gave your content the space to grow.

The ROOT module, as well as any other modules you create, should include the appropriate content type subdirectory when a module uses that content type.

For instance:

* AsciiDoc documents go in the [.path]_pages_ folder.
* Images go in the [.path]_assets/images_ folder.
* Code snippets go in the [.path]_examples_ folder.

Each one of these folders can have an arbitrary depth of topic folders that are used to group files to make them easier for you to manage and navigate.

When a writer is working on the content, the module becomes the writer's primary workspace.
The writer doesn't have to look elsewhere to find files that belong together.
This arrangement mirrors how software developers work on source code.

Let's look at each of these directories and their content type in more detail.

[#attachments-dir]
== Attachments

image::attachments-dir.png[The attachments subdirectory of a module,179]

An attachment is a resource, such as the ZIP archive of a sample project, that a site visitor can download via a link.
Attachment files are saved in the [.path]_attachments_ directory.
A link to an attachment is created using the xref:asciidoc:link-attachment.adoc[AsciiDoc link macro].

=== Binaries and other large files

If your documentation component contains large attachment files, such as binaries of sample projects or libraries, we don't recommend storing them in a regular GitLab or GitHub repository.
Instead, host them in a binary repository such as Bintray or S3, or use git LFS (Large File Storage).

[#examples-dir]
== Examples

image::examples-dir.png[The examples subdirectory of a module,176]

The [.path]_examples_ directory contains non-AsciiDoc file types, such as source code or sample data sets.
An example is inserted into a page using the xref:asciidoc:include-example.adoc[AsciiDoc include directive and the example's resource ID].

[#images-dir]
== Images

image::images-dir.png[The images subdirectory of a module,176]

Image files are saved in the [.path]_images_ directory and inserted into a page using the block or inline xref:asciidoc:insert-image.adoc[AsciiDoc image macro].
AsciiDoc supports PNG, JPG, SVG, and GIF (static and animated) image formats.

[#pages-dir]
== Pages

image::pages-dir.png[The pages subdirectory of a module,174]

AsciiDoc files destined to become xref:page:index.adoc#standard[site pages] are stored in the [.path]_pages_ directory of a module.
These files are converted to HTML and automatically published as individual pages in the generated site.

[#root-module-urls]
=== URLs for ROOT module pages

When the AsciiDoc files stored in the [.path]_pages_ directory of ROOT are published to a documentation site, they're promoted a level above any other modules`' pages in that component's URL.
To demonstrate this concept, let's compare the URLs of two pages, one from a ROOT module and one from a named module.
The standardized directory structure illustrated in <<fig-2>> contains the documentation for a software product named _Hyper Lemur_.
Notice that there is a file named [.path]_deploy.adoc_ in the [.path]_pages_ directory of ROOT.

.Directory structure of the Hyper Lemur documentation.
[#fig-2]
image::hyperlemur-dir-structure.png[,260]

When Antora generates a site that includes the documentation for Hyper Lemur, the URL for the page created from the [.path]_deploy.adoc_ file would look like this.

//.URL for deploy.adoc page in ROOT module
image::root-page-url.svg[ROOT module page URL,role=grow-x]

The base URL, _\https://my-company.com_, xref:playbook:configure-site.adoc#configure-url[is set in the playbook] Antora uses to generate the site.
The component name segment, _hyperlemur_, is set by the `name` key in the xref:component-descriptor.adoc#name-key[component descriptor].
The version segment, _1.0_, is set by the `version` key in the xref:component-descriptor.adoc#version-key[component descriptor].
The page name segment, _deploy_, is the basename of the AsciiDoc file [.path]_deploy.adoc_.

Notice that the name of the module, _ROOT_, isn't in the URL.
Now, let's see what the URL of a page stored in the named module, _admin_, would look like.

[#named-module-urls]
=== URLs for named module pages

AsciiDoc files stored in the [.path]_pages_ directory of named modules are preceded by the name of the module.
The module name is the name of the module directory where that page is stored.
Using the Hyper Lemur documentation shown in <<fig-2>>, let's see what the URL for the [.path]_user-management.adoc_ file stored in the [.path]_pages_ directory of the _admin_ module would look like.

//.URL for user-management.adoc page in a-module
image::module-page-url.svg[Named module page URL,role=grow-x]

Notice that the name of the module, _admin_, is in the URL directly after the documentation component's version.

[#partials-dir]
== Partials

image::partials-dir.png[The partials subdirectory of a module,177]

xref:page:index.adoc#partial[Partials] are AsciiDoc files that contain reusable content snippets such as product descriptions and definitions.
They're stored in the [.path]_partials_ directory in a module.
A partial file or a tagged portion of a partial file is inserted into a page using the xref:asciidoc:include-partial.adoc[AsciiDoc include directive and the partial's resource ID].

[#assets-dir]
.Assets
****
A module can also contain a directory named [.path]_assets_.
This is an alternate location, recognized by Antora, where the [.path]_attachments_ and [.path]_images_ family subdirectories can be placed.

image::component-dir-structure-with-assets.png[The assets subdirectory of a module that contains an images folder and an attachments folder,200]

You don't need to set the path to these predefined subdirectories in the header of your AsciiDoc files.
This is managed automatically by Antora.
****

//[#videos-dir]
//=== Video files

//Self-hosted video files are saved in [.path]_assets/videos_ in the same module where the page that references that video is located.
//Videos are inserted into a page using the xref:asciidoc:embed-video.adoc[AsciiDoc video macro].

////
For instance:

* Full page AsciiDoc documents go in the [.path]_pages_ directory.
* Photographs, diagrams, screenshots, and other graphics go in the [.path]_images_ directory.
* Source code snippets and terminal output go in the [.path]_examples_ directory.
* Reusable, AsciiDoc content snippets, such as product descriptions and definitions, go in the [.path]_partials_ directory.
