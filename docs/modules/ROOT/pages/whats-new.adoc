= Antora {page-component-version}.0

_**Release date:** 2021.12.25 | *Issue label:* {url-milestone-3-0-0}[3.0.0^]_

The Antora {page-component-version}.0 release introduces an event-based extension facility and structured logging, delivers the latest Asciidoctor capabilities, and adds new ways to manage versions.
These are just a few of the new capabilities and updates packed into Antora {page-component-version}.

//TIP: Jump to the <<checklist,upgrade checklist>> for breaking changes that may impact your site when you upgrade from Antora 2.3 to Antora {page-component-version}.

== Antora extensions

Antora now provides a lightweight, event-based extension facility that you can tap into to augment or influence the functionality of the site generator.
The extension facility is designed for users of all experience levels.
Extensions can be configured using the `antora.extensions` key in the playbook.

To learn more, see:

* xref:extend:asynchronous-listeners.adoc[]
* xref:extend:extension-tutorial.adoc[]
* xref:extend:generator-events-reference.adoc[]
* xref:extend:generator-context-reference.adoc[]

== Structured JSON and prettified logging

Antora now provides the infrastructure for logging, shaping, and reporting application messages with the introduction of the Antora Logger component.
All application and Asciidoctor messages, except for CLI warnings, are routed through the logger by default.

The logging in Antora {page-component-version} can be configured with the following keys:

* The xref:playbook:runtime-log-format.adoc[log.format playbook key] specifies the format of the log messages.
* The xref:playbook:runtime-log-level.adoc[log.level playbook key] specifies a severity threshold, such as `debug` or `error`, that must be met for a message to be logged.
* The xref:playbook:runtime-log-failure-level.adoc[log.failure_level playbook key] specifies the severity threshold that, when met or exceeded, causes Antora to fail on exit with a non-zero exit code.
* The xref:playbook:runtime-log-format.adoc#level-format-key[log.level_format key] allows the log level format of JSON messages to be configured as numbers of labels.
* The xref:playbook:runtime-log-destination.adoc[log.destination category key] supports writing log messages to a file or standard stream (`file` key) and settings for buffer size (`buffer_size`), `sync`, and `append`.
* The xref:playbook:asciidoc-sourcemap.adoc[asciidoc.sourcemap key] provides additional file and line number information about AsciiDoc blocks to Antora's logger and Asciidoctor extensions.

== Asciidoctor 2

Antora {page-component-version} now depends on the latest patch version of Asciidoctor.js 2.2, which provides Asciidoctor 2.0.x.
Asciidoctor 2 introduces new AsciiDoc features and a few substantive changes to existing features that may impact your documentation source content or UI.
See xref:asciidoctor-upgrade-notes.adoc[] to learn about the affected features and the suggested actions you should take before upgrading to Antora {page-component-version}.

== Latest version URL customizations

You can now configure the version segment in the URLs of your latest stable and prerelease component version.
The xref:playbook:urls-latest-version-segment.adoc[urls.latest_version_segment playbook key] replaces the actual version with the symbolic version in the published page and asset URLs of the latest component version.
As the key's name implies, it only applies to the latest version of each component version in a site.
The xref:playbook:urls-latest-prerelease-version-segment.adoc[urls.latest_prerelease_version_segment playbook key] replaces the actual version with a symbolic prerelease version in the published page and asset URLs of the latest prereleases in your site.

You can also control the replacement and redirect direction between publishable URLs containing the actual version and URLs containing the symbolic version with the xref:playbook:urls-latest-version-segment-strategy.adoc[urls.latest_version_segment_strategy playbook key].

.Version Choices
****
Antora {page-component-version} provides several new features for configuring the version of a component.
To help support these new version features, there's now documentation explaining xref:how-antora-builds-urls.adoc[] and high-level descriptions of Antora's xref:version-facets.adoc[] to help you decide what keys to use when configuring a version of a component.
We've also updated the information about choosing xref:content-source-versioning-methods.adoc[a versioning strategy for your content].
****

== Map version to git refname

The version for a component version can be derived from the git refname.
The mapping is defined using patterns and replacements on xref:playbook:content-source-version.adoc[the version key on a content source] in the playbook or on xref:component-version-key.adoc[the version key in a component version descriptor].

== New unversioned component version value

In Antora {page-component-version}, we're deprecating the use of the version `master` to identify a versionless component version.
Using that term for this purpose was a mistake and we're correcting it.
We're phasing out this term because it's not descriptive, it infers that the version is coupled to the branch (which it's not), and it glorifies an immoral system based on human exploitation.
In short, the term just isn't appropriate and we want to move away from it.

Now, you can identify a versionless component version by assigning the tilde (`~`) to the `version` key.
See xref:component-with-no-version.adoc[] to learn more.

== ROOT component

Building on the special behavior of the _ROOT_ module, you can now name a component _ROOT_, and the component name will be dropped from the pub(lication) URL and output path of all resources in that component.
The significance of this behavior is that it's now possible to place pages at the root of the published site.
To do so, set the component name (`name` key) to the special value `ROOT` and the version to `~` in [.path]_antora.yml_.

== Symlinks

Antora now supports symlinks in git repositories and on Unix, Unix-like (*nix), and Windows operating systems.
See xref:symlinks.adoc[] to learn how to remap files using symlinks, how Antora handles symlinks to files and directories, and what limitations to keep in mind when using symlinks with Antora.

== Resource IDs for attachments

Attachments are now referenced with the AsciiDoc xref macro and their Antora resource IDs.

----
Download the xref:attachment$packet.zip[course materials] before the first class.
----

When creating a link to an attachment, make sure to use the `attachment$` family coordinate in its resource ID.
See xref:page:attachments.adoc[] for more examples.

== Linked worktrees with filtering

It's now possible to use linked worktrees with Antora.
A linked worktree allows a user to keep multiple branches checked out at once.
(In other words, have one worktree per branch).
Linked worktrees can be useful for editing content across branches.

The xref:playbook:content-worktrees.adoc[worktrees key] controls which worktrees Antora uses when locating branches in a location repository.
By default, Antora will only use the main worktree (i.e., `worktrees: .`), as it has always done.
If you set the `worktrees` key on the content source to `true`, Antora will automatically discover and use linked worktrees as well.
To give you even more control, you can filter which linked trees are discovered by specifying a pattern (e.g., `v2.*`).
The author mode page provides a step-by-step guide for setting up xref:playbook:author-mode.adoc#multiple-worktrees[multiple worktrees] for local authoring.

== New default branches pattern

The default branches pattern has changed from `[master, v*]` to `HEAD, v{0..9}*`.
`HEAD` is a symbolic name that refers to the default branch for remote repositories (as set on the git host) and the current branch for local repositories.
It's very unlikely this will cause a change when using remote repositories.
For local repositories, it may result in the worktree being used in cases it wasn't previously.

== New git playbook keys

The xref:playbook:git-plugins.adoc[git.plugins key] provides a way to specify predefined plugins to load into the git client used by Antora.

The xref:playbook:git-fetch-concurrency.adoc[git.fetch_concurrency key] controls the maximum number of fetch or clone operations that are permitted to run at once.

== Network proxy

Antora {page-component-version} now honors the environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy`.
These settings can also be defined under the `network` category key in the playbook.
See xref:playbook:network-proxy.adoc[] to learn about Antora's automatic support for industry standard proxy environment variables.

TIP: Note that Antora 2 didn't honor the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables.
If you're migrating from Antora 2 to Antora {page-component-version}, and you encounter a network error (Bad response: 503), the automatic proxy support in Antora {page-component-version} may be the culprit.
See the <<checklist,upgrade checklist>> for help.

== Generator in playbook

As an alternative to the `--generator` CLI option, it's now possible to specify the custom generator in the playbook using the `antora.generator` key.
The key accepts the same value as the CLI option (i.e., a path or require request).
As part of this change, the meaning of the path prefixes changed to align with other paths defined in the playbook.

* If the first path segment is a tilde (`~`), the path is resolved relative to the user's home directory.
* If the first path segment is a dot (`.`), the path is resolved relative to the playbook file.
* If the first path segment is a tilde plus (`~+`), the path is resolved relative to the current directory.
* If the path is a relative path with a file extension and without any of these prefixes, the path is resolved relative to the current directory.

For portability, you're encourage to always use either the `./` or `~+` prefix when specifying a relative path.

The value also accepts any require request (i.e., module name) supported by Antora's user require helper.
See the https://gitlab.com/antora/user-require-helper/-/blob/main/README.adoc#user-content-usage[@antora/user-require-helper documentation^] details.

[#checklist]
== Upgrade checklist

include::install:partial$upgrade-checklist.adoc[tag=new]

== Deprecation summary

The following deprecations are final in Antora {page-component-version}.0.

* The default branches pattern of `[master, v*]` is deprecated; the default branches pattern is now `HEAD, v{0..9}*`.
* Referencing attachments with the link macro (`+link:[]+`) and the `attachmentsdir` attribute are deprecated; use the xref:page:attachments.adoc[AsciiDoc xref macro and the resource ID of the attachment] to link to an attachment.
* Using parent references in the target of the AsciiDoc include directive; use the resource ID of the page, partial, or example, or in the case of relative files within the same family use the relative path token (`./`) instead.
* The `partialsdir` and `examplesdir` attributes are deprecated.
Use the resource ID of the xref:page:include-a-partial.adoc[partial] or xref:page:include-an-example.adoc[example] to reference the resource instead.
* Using the value `master` to represent an unversioned (empty) version when assigned to the `version` key in a component descriptor file is deprecated; use the tilde symbol (`~`) to represent an unversioned component version instead.
In Antora 4, the value `master`, when assigned to the `version` will be treated as a regular value.
* The fallback mechanism that automatically assigned the _.adoc_ file extension to the resource IDs of pages if it was missing in AsciiDoc xref macros and `page-aliases` values is deprecated in to make way for using non-AsciiDoc pages in AsciiDoc xref macros.
* isomorphic-git no longer includes the `cores` API.
Antora still honors the `cores` API, but the call to register the credential manager is now responsible for creating it because it runs before Antora loads.
Refer to xref:playbook:private-repository-auth.adoc#custom[Configure a custom credential manager] for the latest instructions.

The <<deprecated>> and <<removed>> sections list all of the deprecated and removed features in Antora {page-component-version}.

Null is assigned using the tilde symbol (`~`) or the keyword `null`.
Internally, the value is coerced to empty string for practical purposes.
+
* If the version is empty (`version: ~`), don't add a version segment to `pub.url` and `out.path` (even if it's a prerelease).
* Sort the versionless version above all other versions (semantic and non-semantic) that belong to the same component.
* Assign the fallback _default_ as the display version if the version is empty and the `display_version` key isn't specified.
* If `prerelease` is set in the component descriptor to a string value, use that as the fallback display version instead.
* If the version is not specified on an alias that specifies an unknown component, set the version to empty string.
We expect this change to be internal and not affect any sites.
