= Customize the Display Version

The `display_version` key is strictly used for presentation purposes in the reference UI when a component version's official version contains uppercase letters, symbols, or blank spaces.
It doesn't affect page and resource IDs, the version segment in the page URL, or how component versions are sorted.

[#display-version-key]
== display_version key

The `display_version` key is optional.
It's set in a component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file and used by the reference UI where ever the version is displayed, including the xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-menu[component navigation menu], xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-dropdown[component version selector], and xref:navigation:index.adoc#page-dropdown[page version selector].

If `display_version` isn't set, the reference UI falls back to xref:component-name-and-version.adoc#version-key[the version key].
Unlike `version`, the value of `display_version` can contain empty spaces, uppercase letters, and most characters (e.g., `3.0 Beta`, `RED WREN!`, `rawhide`).

.antora.yml
[source,yaml]
----
name: colorado
title: Colorado âˆ†
version: '5.6'
display_version: '5.6 (EOL)' # <1>
----
<1> If the value starts with a number, enclose it within a set of single quote marks (`'`).

The `display_version` key should be used when a version contains spaces or characters that break Antora's page and resource IDs, prevent portability between web servers, and aren't recommended in URLs.
It's also useful when the component version is a prerelease or is archived since the value of `display_version` doesn't affect page URLs or internal IDs.

Prerelease versions (e.g., alpha, beta, etc.) can also be configured with xref:component-prerelease.adoc[the prerelease key].
The `prerelease` key provides additional UI presentation and sorting capabilities.
//The `display_version` key overrides the label assigned to the `prerelease` key when both keys are set in the component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file.

[#assign-display-version]
== Assign a display_version to a component version

Let's expand on the [.path]_antora.yml_ example where you previously learned xref:component-name-and-version.adoc#assign-name-and-version[how to assign a component name and version].
The _Silver Leaf_ project team wants the version code name in addition to its version number to be displayed in the UI.
Since `version` can't contain blank spaces, let's set `display_version` in the component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file.

. Open the component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file in the text editor or IDE of your choice.

.antora.yml for the component version silver-leaf 7.1
[source,yaml]
----
name: silver-leaf
title: Silver Leaf
version: '7.1'
----

. On a blank line, type `display_version`, directly followed by a colon (`:`).
. Insert a blank space after the colon, and then type the value you want to assign to `display_version`.
Since the value begins with a number, enclose it in a set of single quote marks (`'`).
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: silver-leaf
title: Silver Leaf
version: '7.1'
display_version: '7.1 Spiny'
----

. Save the file.

Now, the UI will display _7.1 Spiny_ in the component navigation menu, component version selector, and page version selector.
