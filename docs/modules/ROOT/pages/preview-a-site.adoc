= Preview a Site

On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to preview a site locally.
* [x] How to run an optional local server to preview a site locally.

== Local site preview

Since Antora generates static sites, *you do not have to publish the site to a web server to view it*.
A site generated by Antora works just as well using the browser's local file: protocol.
This characteristic of an Antora site is an essential tool for previewing your work.

To view the site locally, navigate to any HTML page inside the destination folder in your browser.
If you're following along with the Demo, look for the file [.path]_build/site/index.html_ in your project.
You will be viewing the HTML pages through the file: protocol of the browser, which you can see in the location bar.

== Run a local server (optional)

Although the site is viewable without a web server, you may still need to view your site through a web server to test certain features, such as indexified URLs, caching, or scripts that don't work over the file: protocol.
You can use the *node-srv* package for this purpose.
https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/node-srv[node-srv] is a simple, static web server for Node.

Install the *node-srv* package globally using npm:

 demo-site $ npm i -g node-srv

or Yarn:

 demo-site $ yarn global add node-srv

That puts a command by the same name on your PATH.

Now launch the web server by pointing it at the location of the generated site.
In the terminal, type the command name, `node-srv`, followed by the `-r` flag, then the location of the generated site (i.e., the output dir).
After launching the command, the local address of the web server will be displayed in your terminal.

 demo-site $ node-srv build/site

You should see the following output in your terminal:

[.output]
....
Server node-srv running at
 => http://localhost:8000

Logs are off.
....

Paste the provided URL into the location bar of your browser to view your site through a local web server.

Press kbd:[Ctrl,C] to stop the server.

TIP: If you get a port conflict when starting the server (i.e., `listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use`), you can use the `-p <port>` option to change to another port.
For example, use `-p 5000` to switch to port 5000.

////
When generation is complete, you'll see a URL in the terminal that is specific to your machine.

[.output]
....
Loading theme bundle from GitHub release: ...
Using content from repository: ...
...
Finished in 0:00:45
Site can be viewed at file:///home/user/projects/docs-site/build/site
....

You can follow this URL to preview the site locally in your browser.

Depending on what you built, you may have to navigate to an HTML file from that location to see the actual site.
