[#examples-dir]
== Examples family directory

A module directory can contain an xref:family-directories.adoc[optional family directory] named [.path]_examples_.

Antora applies preset behavior to the source files stored in an [.path]_examples_ directory when it generates a site.

[#examples]
== Example files

Example files, also called examples, are resources, such as source code files or snippets (e.g., [.path]_runner.js_), terminal output, and data sets (e.g., [.path]_choptank-co2.csv_).
The files are stored in an [.path]_examples_ directory.

Antora doesn't automatically publish example files.
The xref:page:include-an-example.adoc[example must be referenced by an include directive] from a page, or resource that's eventually included in a page, for the example's content to be published.

TIP: Examples shouldn't be confused with the AsciiDoc example block, though an example file can be inserted into an example block using an include directive.
