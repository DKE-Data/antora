[#examples-dir]
== Examples family directory

A module directory can contain an optional xref:family-directories.adoc[family directory] named [.path]_examples_.

Antora applies preset behavior to the source files stored in an [.path]_examples_ directory when it generates a site.

[#examples]
== Examples

[.term]*Examples* are source code snippets (e.g., [.path]_runner.js_), terminal output, or sample data sets (e.g., [.path]_choptank-co2.csv_).
The source files for examples are stored in an [.path]_examples_ directory.
Examples shouldn't be confused with the AsciiDoc example block, though they can be inserted into an example block using an include directive.

If an example isn't referenced in an AsciiDoc include directive, its content won't be published to a site (unlike xref:pages-directory.adoc#pages[pages]).
Examples and tagged regions in an example can be inserted into any page or partial, regardless of the module or component version it belongs to, using the xref:asciidoc:include-partial.adoc[include directive and the example's resource ID].

When referencing an example, the `example` family name must be included in its resource ID.
The  family name, `example`, is required because the include directive is also used to reference xref:partials-directory.adoc[partial source files].
