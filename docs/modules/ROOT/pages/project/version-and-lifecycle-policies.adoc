== Version policy

Antora follows the semantic versioning rules.
Each Antora component release is versioned *major.minor.patch*.

Major::
Major releases occur when there are substantial changes in functionality or when new functionality breaks backwards compatibility.
Releases within the same major version number will maintain API compatibility.

Minor::
Minor releases add new features, improvements to existing features, and fixes that maintain backwards compatibility.

Patch::
Patch releases fix bugs and maintain backwards compatibility.
Only the latest minor release for a major release will receive patches.
Patch releases happen as needed depending on the urgency of the fix.

Pre-release::
Major and minor releases may include pre-release versions (major.minor.patch-alpha.n | -beta.n | -rc.n).
Pre-release versions will be tagged as _next_ so that the npm client doesn't prefer a pre-release over a stable version.
Once a release candidate (rc) has been thoroughly tested, the stable release will be published.

== Lifecycle policy

Each major version of the xref:pipeline:supported-components.adoc#core[Antora Core components] and Core UI Model is supported for at least one year after the major version enters General Availability (GA).
Once a major version reaches End of Life (EOL), it will not receive maintenance releases.

[#lifecycle-phases]
=== Lifecycle phases

General Availability (GA)::
Software enters General Availability on the date an initial major version is released and available for download.

General Support (GS)::
General Support begins on the date a major release enters General Availability.

End of General Support (EOGS)::
General Support ends on the date a major release reaches its End of Life.

End of Life (EOL)::
The date after which the software no longer receives maintenance releases.
