Antora uses information in a playbook ([.path]_site.yml_) to fetch the content and the UI bundle used to control the visual layout, style, and behavior of those pages.

The playbook makes it possible for documentation writers to control what content is included in their site without needing any programming knowledge.
It is a configuration file that contains an inventory of content repository addresses and branch names, a UI bundle address and tag, and global documentation site information.
You'll use the playbook to tell Antora what content you want included in your site and where you want the site published.

More specifically, the playbook tells Antora:

* [x] The title of the published site.
* [x] The URL of the published site (used for canonical URLs and URLs in the sitemap).
//* [x] The component which sits at the root of the site (i.e., home or landing page content). (pending feature)
* [x] Which content repositories and branches to feed into the Antora site generator.
* [x] Which UI bundle to use to control the visual layout, style, and behavior of the pages in the site.
//* [x] A list of paths of xref:navigation:aspect.adoc[aspect navigation domains] to use (navigation which is not linked to any given component). (pending feature)
