Tech writers can control what content is included in their site, what user interface (UI) is applied to it, and where the site is published with a playbook.
An Antora playbook makes it easy for writers to control a site without needing any programming knowledge.

Specifically, a playbook tells Antora:

* [x] The title of the published site.
* [x] The URL of the published site.
* [x] What service accounts, like Google Analytics, should be integrated into the site.
//* [x] The component which sits at the root of the site (i.e., home or landing page content). (pending feature)
* [x] Which content repositories and branches to feed into the Antora site generator.
* [x] Which UI bundle to use to control the visual layout, style, and behavior of the pages.
* [x] Where the site should be published and in what format.

Alternative playbook summaries

Antora uses a playbook to set up a documentation site, locate and organize the site's source content and UI bundle, and publish the site to one or multiple destinations.
A playbook is a configuration file that contains an inventory of content repository addresses and branch names, a UI bundle address and tag, and global documentation site information.
You'll use the playbook to tell Antora what content you want included in your site and where you want the site published.
