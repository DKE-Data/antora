As authors, you can control what content is included in your site, what user interface (UI) is applied to it, and where the site is published using a playbook file.
The playbook file is designed to make it easy for writers to control a site without needing any programming knowledge.
The settings in this file are used to make a playbook, the runtime configuration object that tells Antora how to operate.

Specifically, a playbook tells Antora:

* [x] What information should be applied to the xref:configure-site.adoc[site globally], such as its title, base URL, and service integrations.
//* [x] The component which sits at the root of the site (i.e., home or landing page content). (pending feature)
* [x] Which xref:configure-content-sources.adoc[content repositories and branches] to feed into the Antora site generator.
* [x] Which UI bundle to use to control the visual layout, style, and behavior of the pages.
* [x] Where the site should be xref:configure-output.adoc[published and in what format].

Certain settings from the playbook file can be overridden using CLI options or environment variables, which allows the operation team to tailor the behavior for specific environments, such as production.

Alternative playbook summaries

Antora uses a playbook to set up a documentation site, locate and organize the site's source content and UI bundle, and publish the site to one or multiple destinations.
A playbook is a configuration file that contains an inventory of content repository addresses and branch names, a UI bundle address and tag, and global documentation site information.
You'll use the playbook to tell Antora what content you want included in your site and where you want the site published.
