On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to configure the cache directory.
* [x] How to pull updates to content sources and UI.

== Cache directory

The first time Antora runs, it will cache remote git repositories and remote UI bundle.
On subsequent runs, Antora will attempt to resolve remote resources from the cache instead.

This section explains where the cache is located by default and how to configure the location of the cache.

[#default-cache]
=== Default cache directory

The default location for the cache varies by operating system.

* Linux: [.path]_$XDG_CACHE_HOME/antora_ (or [.path]_$HOME/.cache/antora_ if `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` is not set)
* macOS: [.path]_$HOME/Library/Caches/antora_
* Windows: [.path]_$APPDATA/antora/Caches_

Before downloading remote resources, Antora will first look for those resources in the cache folder, which maps to the user's cache folder by default.
If you want to instruct Antora to update the cache, configure Antora to <<pull,pull updates>>.
Another option is to locate the Antora cache directory on your system and delete it.

[#cache-dir]
=== Specify a cache directory

The cache directory can be specified using the cache dir key (`cache_dir`) under the `runtime` category in the playbook.
The key specifies the directory where the remote repositories should be cloned and the remote UI bundle should be downloaded.
The key accepts a relative or absolute filesystem path.

[source,yaml]
----
runtime:
  cache_dir: ./.antora-cache
----

In this case, the value resolves to the folder [.path]_.antora-cache_ relative to the location of the playbook file (because of the leading `.`).

The resolution rules for `cache-dir` are the same as for any path in the playbook.
A relative path is expanded to an absolute path using the following rules:

* If the first path segment is a tilde (`~`), the remaining path is resolved relative to the user's home directory.
* If the first path segment is a dot (`.`), the remaining path is resolved relative to the location of the playbook file.
* If the first path segment is tilde plus (`~+`), or does not begin with an aforementioned prefix, the remaining path is resolved relative to the current working directory.

[#pull]
== Pull updates

As previously stated, the first time Antora runs, it caches the remote git repositories and remote UI bundle.
On subsequent runs, it uses these resources from the cache folder by default (effectively running offline).

If you want Antora to refresh the cache, you must set the `pull` key under the `runtime` category to true.

[source,yaml]
----
runtime:
  pull: true
----

Most of the time, however, you'll just use the `--pull` CLI switch instead of modifying the playbook directly.
This switch is mapped to the `pull` key described in this section.

Setting the `pull` key to true activates two behaviors in Antora:

. Run a fetch operation on all cloned repositories (content sources that are remote)
. Download the UI bundle fresh (if the UI bundle is remote)

You only need to enable the `pull` key when you want to retrieve updates to the remote content sources and/or remote UI bundle.
