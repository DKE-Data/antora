= Base URL

[#url-key]
== url key

The `url` key is required.
It's configured under the xref:configure-site.adoc[site key] in a playbook.

.antora-playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
site:
  title: Site Title
  url: https://example.org
----

The `url` key defines the base URL of the published site.
The value must be an absolute URL (e.g., _\https://docs.example.com_) or a root-relative pathname (e.g., _/docs_).
The value *shouldn't end with a trailing slash.*

[#configure-url]
== Configure absolute base URL

An absolute `url` value must start with a valid URL scheme directly followed by a colon and two slashes (`://`).
Common schemes include `https://` and `file://`.
Absolute URLs can include a pathname segment (e.g., _\https://example.com/docs_).

.antora-playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
site:
  title: Demo Docs Site
  url: https://demo.antora.org
----

The site URL is used in the generated site when either an absolute URL is required or a pathname.
It also implicitly activates any features that require an absolute URL or a pathname.

=== Absolute base URL features

The canonical URL property gets included in the head of each published page.
The component, version, module, and page segments are then appended to the site URL to produce the complete URL.
For example, _\https://docs.example.org/component/version/page.html_.

The generated sitemap and xref:site-robots-file.adoc[robots.txt files] require an absolute URL are the sitemap files.
The 404 page and URL prefix on redirect rules require a pathname, which can be derived from the absolute URL.
