* [x] The purpose of an Antora playbook.
* [x] How a playbook drives an Antora pipeline.

== What is a playbook?

An Antora playbook is a configuration file.
It tells an Antora pipeline what content to use, how the content should be processed, how the site should be generated, and where to publish the output.

// With an Antora playbook, you can control what content is included in your site.

=== Playbook format and structure

Playbooks can be written in YAML, JSON, and CSON.

YAML is a common configuration language for defining automated tasks.
Most of the playbook examples in this documentation use YAML since it is less verbose than JSON and CSON.

Regardless of the format, a playbook contains structured xref:playbook-keys.adoc[key sets] for specifying general site properties, content and UI input sources, and published output destinations and providers.

== Where is a playbook stored?

A playbook is usually located at the root of a xref:set-up-existing-playbook-project.adoc[playbook project].
