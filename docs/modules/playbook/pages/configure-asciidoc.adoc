== Global document attributes

If you find yourself defining the same AsciiDoc document attributes over and over in every page, you can move these attributes to the playbook, where you only have to define them once.
Antora then adds these attributes to every page it converts.

You can define global (i.e., site-wide) AsciiDoc document attributes using the `attributes` key under the `asciidoc` category in the playbook.
This key accepts a map of name-value pairs.
The attribute names can be:

* {uri-attrs}[built-in AsciiDoc attributes^] you want to override such as `sectnums`, `hide-uri-scheme`, `linkattrs`,
* custom attributes that are specific to your content (e.g., `product-name`), and
* attributes for configuring the behavior of custom extensions (e.g., `plantuml-server-url`).

.Defining global AsciiDoc document attributes
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    hide-uri-scheme: ''
    product-name: 'Instant Container Maker'
    toc: ~
----

These attributes will be applied and now available to use on every page in your site.
You can output the value of these attributes using the attribute reference syntax (e.g., `+{product-name}+`).

CAUTION: Certain built-in attributes are not applicable in the Antora environment.
These attributes include `data-uri`, `allow-uri-read`, `docinfo`, `linkcss`, `noheader`, `nofooter`, `webfonts`, and `outfilesuffix`.
Assigning a value to these attributes either has no effect or may cause Antora to malfunction.
Other attributes, such as `imagesdir`, are automatically set by Antora and cannot be overridden.

=== Attribute value types

There are three attribute value types in AsciiDoc: String, Number, and Boolean.

If the attribute value is a _String_, we recommend enclosing the value in quotes just to be safe.
(If you're using YAML for your playbook, you may be able to drop the quotes in most cases).

If the attribute value is a _Number_, no quotes are required around the value.

If the attribute value is a _Boolean_, use an empty string (i.e., `''`) to set the attribute and a null value (i.e., `null` or `~`) to unset the value.

You can also use a null value to unset any type of attribute (e.g., `table-caption: ~`).
This is a good way to disable attributes that authors may use for local preview but should never be set in Antora (e.g., `toc`).

== Default attribute values

Sometimes, you want to assign a default value to an attribute, but still allow a given page to override that value.
By default, an attribute defined in the playbook overrides any assignment in the document (i.e., page) itself.
This behavior can be changed by appending a modifier.

If you add the `@` symbol at the end of an attribute value defined in the playbook, it lowers the precedence of the attribute assignment so a page may override the value.
The `@` modifier is then dropped from the value.
We refer to this as [.term]_soft setting_ an attribute.

.Defining attributes that can be overridden by a page
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    product-name: 'Instant Container Maker@'

Now, any page can override this attribute as follows:

:product-name: Explosive Container Maker

Unfortunately, it's not possible to soft unset an attribute.
