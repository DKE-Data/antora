The behavior of Antora is determined by a runtime configuration object called a [.term]_playbook_.
As the site author, you populate the playbook using a playbook configuration file, or [.term]_playbook file_ for short.
You can override certain settings specified in the playbook file using CLI options and environment variables.
These settings get compiled to make the playbook.

Let's begin by learning what inputs, outputs, and behaviors the playbook file can control.
