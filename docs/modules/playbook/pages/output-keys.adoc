On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to configure the output directory key.
* [x] How to configure the destinations provider key.
* [x] How to configure the destinations path key.

== Directory key

The output dir key specifies the directory where the generated site will be published.
The value should not contain a leading forward slash or trailing forward slash (`/`).
The key accepts relative and absolute filesystem paths.
When the value is a relative path, the site will be published to that location in the directory Antora was executed from (i.e., current working directory).

IMPORTANT: The dir key overrides the path key for any `fs` provider specified in the destinations key.

=== Default output directory

The default output directory value is [.path]_build/site_.
All of the site files will be written into this directory.

[#add-dir]
=== Specify output directory

In the relative `dir` example, the site will be published to a folder named [.path]_launch_ inside your current working directory.

.Relative dir value
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
output:
 dir: launch
----

In the absolute `dir` example, the site will be published to [.path]_home/dev/docs-site/beta_ no matter what directory Antora is run from.

.Absolute dir value
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
output:
 dir: home/dev/docs-site/beta
----

== Provider key

The destinations provider key specifies the protocol Antora should use to publish the site.

Antora has two built-in provider protocols.

.Built-in providers
* Filesystem (`fs`)
* Archive (`archive`)

You can also create custom providers for SSH, SFTP, etc.

=== Default provider

The default provider protocol is the filesystem (`fs`).
When no provider is specified, Antora publishes the site to the local filesytem at the default output directory location or the location specified by the dir key.

[#add-archive]
=== Publish a site as a ZIP file

The `archive` provider publishes a site as a ZIP file.

.Archive provider
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
output:
 destinations:
 - provider: archive
----

In this example, the archived site will be located at [.path]_build/site.zip_.

== Path key

The path key allows you to add file paths per provider.
The value should not contain a leading forward slash or trailing forward slash (`/`).
The key accepts relative and absolute filesystem paths.

IMPORTANT: If you set the dir key in the playbook or via the CLI, its value will override the `path` value for any `fs` provider specified in the destinations key.

=== Default path values

The default `fs` path is the same as the default output directory value ([.path]_build/site_).
This is because `fs` is the default provider.

The default archive provider path is [.path]_build/site.zip_.

[#archive-path]
=== Specify an archive path

// Check this path output
In the relative path example, we're running Antora from a directory named [.path]_docs-site_.

.Relative archive provider path
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
output:
 destinations:
 - provider: archive
   path: blue.zip
----

Once generation is complete, the archived site will be published at [.path]_docs-site/build/blue.zip_.

In the absolute path example, we can run Antora from any location on our computer (as long as it is installed globally).

.Absolute archive provider path
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
output:
 destinations:
 - provider: archive
   path: ~/projects/docs-site/blue.zip
----

Once generation is complete, the archived site will be published at [.path]_docs-site/blue.zip_.

////
When a value is assigned to the output directory key, the archive path is appended to the `dir` path.

.Dir and archive provider path
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
output:
 dir: launch/sites
 destinations:
 - provider: archive
   path: blue.zip
----

In this example, the archived site will be located at [.path]_launch/sites/blue.zip_.
////

[#abs-rel-path]
=== Specify fs and archive providers and paths

In this example, we're running Antora from a directory named [.path]_tmp_ and publishing  the site to two different locations.

.Relative fs path and absolute archive path
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
output:
 destinations:
 - provider: fs
   path: releases/red
 - provider: archive
   path: ~/projects/docs-site/blue.zip
----

The site published via the `fs` provider will be located at [.path]_tmp/releases/red_.
The site published via `archive` will be located at [.path]_~/projects/docs-site/blue.zip_.
