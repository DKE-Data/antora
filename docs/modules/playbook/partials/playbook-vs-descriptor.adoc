[NOTE]
.Playbook file versus component version descriptor file
====
Attributes are declared using the same structure and syntax in both the playbook file and the component version descriptor file.

The xref:playbook:index.adoc[playbook] is where you configure the site, content sources, and UI URLs.
The playbook file usually has the word _playbook_ in its file name, e.g., [.path]_antora-playbook.yml_ or [.path]_local-antora-playbook.yml_.

The xref:ROOT:component-version-descriptor.adoc[component version descriptor] is where you configure the name, version, metadata, attributes, and navigation list for a component version.
A component version descriptor's file name is always [.path]_antora.yml_.
