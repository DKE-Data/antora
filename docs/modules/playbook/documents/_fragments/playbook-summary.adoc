You configure Antora to generate the documentation site you want to make using a playbook.
The playbook provides Antora with the following information:

* [x] Which content repositories and branches to feed into Antora's generator.
* [x] Which UI bundle to use to control the visual layout, style, and behavior of the pages in the site.
* [x] A list of paths of aspect navigation domains to use (navigation which is not linked to any given component).
* [x] The URL of the published site (used for canonical URLs and URLs in the sitemap).
* [x] The component which sits at the root of the site (i.e., the landing content).
