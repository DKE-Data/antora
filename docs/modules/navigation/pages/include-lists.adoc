= Include Lists

== Include navigation content

It's possible to include navigation content from a partial using the AsciiDoc include directive.
Keep in mind that target of the include directive needs to be indexed by Antora.
The default [.path]_modules/XYZ/nav.adoc_ location of navigation files is not indexed, therefore the best way is to place partial navigation files into [.path]_modules/XYZ/partials/my-partial-nav.adoc_.

.nav.adoc
[source]
----
* xref:index.adoc[]
+
--
\include::XYZ:partial$my-partial-nav.adoc[]
--
----

The included navigation file should contain the desired text and list formatting.
