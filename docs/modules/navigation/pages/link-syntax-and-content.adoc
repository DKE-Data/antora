List titles and items in a navigation file can contain several types of content, such as text, images, and icons.
In most cases this content will link to a page or resource in your site.

== Link types

When content is linked, then a website visitor can click on the visible content and jump to another page or resource.
The syntax used to link the content depends on what the destination page or resource is and where it is located.

Site pages::
When the link destination is a page in your site, the link is created using the Antora cross referencing system (`\xref:page-id[link content]`).

Site attachments::
When the link destination is an attachment resource, the link is created using the link macro (`+link:{attachmentsdir}/filename.ext[link content]+`).

Other websites and resources::
When the link destination is a website or resource that isn't part of your site, i.e., it isn't stored in a documentation component, the link is created using a valid URI scheme and address (`+https://website.com[link content]+`).
//or, in a few unique cases, with the link macro.

//Content in an Antora navigation source file becomes a link when it is marked up with a cross reference (`xref`) or a valid URI scheme and address.

[#page]
== Site page links

Cross references in a navigation list are constructed using the xref:page:page-id.adoc#whats-a-cross-reference[AsciiDoc xref macro] and a xref:page:page-id.adoc[valid page ID]
Set up the `xref` macro, insert the destination page ID, and add the link content.
The link content can be text, images, and/or icons.
The link content is visible to the visitor in the component version's page menu.
It is also displayed in the breadcrumbs at the top of the destination page.
When a visitor clicks on the link content, they are routed to the destination page specified by the page ID in the xref.

=== In-module page links

The most common items in a navigation list are xrefs to pages in xref:filenames-and-locations.adoc#storage[the same module where the navigation file is stored].
In this case, the page ID doesn't require the component or module coordinates.

[source]
----
.xref:index.adoc[In-module page]
* xref:a-page-in-this-module.adoc[Another in-module page]
** xref:another-page.adoc#and-fragment[An in-module page deep link]
* xref:topic/page.adoc[In-module page in a topic folder]
----

=== Links to pages in other modules and component versions

Using the appropriate page ID pattern, you can link to any page in the site from a navigation list, whether it belongs to a xref:page:module-and-page-xrefs.adoc#xref-page-across-modules[different module] or xref:page:version-and-component-xrefs.adoc[docs component].

[source]
----
* xref:index.adoc[In-module page]
* xref:other-module:page.adoc[Page in the same component version, but a different module]
** xref:topic/page.adoc[In-module page in a topic folder]
*** xref:other-module:page.adoc#fragment[A deep link to a page in the same component version, but a different module]
*** xref:other-component:module:page.adoc[Page in another docs component]
----

[#resource]
== Site resource links

An attachment is a resource stored in an xref:ROOT:attachments-directory.adoc[_attachments_ directory] that you want your user to visit or download.
To xref:asciidoc:link-attachment.adoc[insert a link to an attachment], use the AsciiDoc link macro (`+link:[]+`).

[source]
----
* link:{attachmentsdir}/filename.ext[Link to resource in attachments directory]
----

[#urls]
== Other website and resource links

A navigation list can contain links to websites and resources that are not part of your site.
These links are created using the xref:asciidoc:external-urls.adoc#url-syntax[AsciiDoc URL syntax], which requires a valid URI scheme and address.
//In a few unique cases, the link is created with a link macro.

[source]
----
* https://external-website.com[Link to another website]
----

[#content]
== Unlinked content

When you want to display content in a navigation list, but you don't want it to be a link, simply don't mark it up with any link syntax.

[source]
----
* Unlinked Content
** xref:a-page.adoc[Linked Content]
----

== Including navigation content

It is possible to include navigation content from another page using the `include::` macro.
Keep in mind that the include target needs to be indexed by Antora.
The default `modules/XYZ/nav.adoc` location of navigation files is not indexed, therefore the best way is to place partial navigation files into `modules/XYZ/partials/my-partial-nav.adoc`.

[source,asciidoc]
----
* xref:index.adoc[In-module page]
+
--
include::XYZ:partial$my-partial-nav.adoc[]
--
----

The included navigation file should contain the desired text and list formatting.

== Formatted text

Whether linked or unlinked, the text you want displayed in your component version page menu can be formatted using inline AsciiDoc markup.

[source]
----
* xref:index.adoc[*Bold linked text*]
* `Monospaced` text
* https://other-website.com[Some __ita__lic letters]
----

== Images

A navigation item can be an image.
To include an image, use the inline image macro (`+image:filename.ext[]+`).
The inline image macro has only one colon (`:`).

[source]
----
.image:status.png[] // <1>
* xref:index.adoc[image:star.svg[] What's New] // <2>
----
<1> Unlinked image
<2> Linked image

Xrefs::
A cross reference (xref) to a page in your documentation site.
An xref always contains a page ID; the unique identifier assign to each documentation page.
The xref usually also contains link content, such as text or an icon, that, when clicked on in the component navigation menu, takes the visitor to the webpage that corresponds with the page ID.
Cross references that don't include link content are called bare.
