With Antora, tech writers can create their site's navigation with AsciiDoc and store it right alongside their documentation files.

== Describe your navigation using AsciiDoc lists

A siteâ€™s navigation is described by one or more AsciiDoc lists.
Page links are added using the same cross referencing syntax used in the pages themselves.
There's no special syntax or UI template logic to learn.

== No content or organization restrictions

In addition to cross references, the navigation lists can contain normal text, images, icons, and links to pages not created by the generator pipeline.
The links in the navigation can be ordered and nested in the arrangement of your choice.

== What's next?

* xref:create-a-navigation-file.adoc[Set up a new navigation file] and add different types of content to it.
* Organize navigation files in a component.
* Select the order the navigation lists should be displayed in a published site.

////
describe and control the navigation structure as a content concern; navigation stored with the content; author-controlled, yet can still be manipulated by the UI / designer
