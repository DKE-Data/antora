With Antora, tech writers can create their site's navigation with AsciiDoc and store it right alongside their documentation files.

== Navigation workflow

In order to populate a navigation menu for a component on your site, you need to create at least one navigation source file and then register that file in the component's descriptor file.

== Navigation source files

A componentâ€™s navigation is described by one or more AsciiDoc lists in one or more navigation source files.
Page links are added using the same cross referencing syntax used in the pages themselves.
In addition to xrefs, the lists can contain normal text, images, icons, and URLs to other sites.
There's no special syntax or UI template logic to learn.

When you want these lists to be displayed in a component's published menu, you need to register them.

== Registration

Navigation files are registered using the nav key (`nav`) in the component descriptor file.
The order in which the files are listed is the order in which they're displayed in the component's menu on the published site.

== Component menu

Antora assembles the registered navigation source files for each version of each component.
It then publishes the output to a navigation menu for each component version.
The behavior and styling of the menu is dictated by the UI bundle that was specified in the playbook.

* xref:create-a-navigation-file.adoc[Set up a new navigation file] and add different types of content to it.
* Organize navigation files in a component.
* Select the order the navigation lists should be displayed in a published site.

describe and control the navigation structure as a content concern; navigation stored with the content; author-controlled, yet can still be manipulated by the UI / designer
