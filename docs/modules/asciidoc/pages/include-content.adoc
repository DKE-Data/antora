You can use the include directive (`include::[]`) to insert content from another file into an AsciiDoc file.
You can include a <<include-partial,partial>>, a <<include-page,standard page>>, or an <<include-example,example file>>.
Partial and standard pages are AsciiDoc files; examples are often other file types, such as source code or data values.

There are a few things to know about using the include directive in the Antora environment, which this page covers.
