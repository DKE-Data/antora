On this page, you'll find the list of Antora components that can be assembled into a custom site generator pipeline.
Antora has a modular architecture so that components can be easily removed and replaced.
Due to its API, you can also integrate Asciidoctor extensions.

[#core]
== Core components

*Core* components are assembled into a pipeline by the Site Generator Default component.
The Core components are versioned together.
At this time, only Core components that are the same version work together, i.e., if you want to use the Content Classifier and Page Composer in a custom pipeline, make sure you use the same version of each component.

== Extended components

*Extended* components are developed and maintained in the official Antora organization.
These components provide useful functionality for specific use cases.
An example of an Extended component is a site publisher provider for an Amazon S3 bucket.
Once an Extended component is ready for xref:ROOT:project/version-and-lifecycle-policies.adoc#lifecycle-phases[General Availability], it will be released and versioned separately from the Core components.
