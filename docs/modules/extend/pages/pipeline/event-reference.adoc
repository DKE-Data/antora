= Pipeline Event Reference
:nosp:

Antora pipeline extensions listen for events emitted by the site generator and other components in the Antora pipeline.
Each listener can access variables that are in scope at the time the event is emitted.
The following table lists the pipeline events in the order they are emitted and the in-scope variables that correspond to each event.
If the variable is locked (meaning it cannot be replaced), it's marked with an asterisk (`*`).
