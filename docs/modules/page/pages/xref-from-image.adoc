= Xref a Page From an Image

In the same way you can cross references with simple xref:navigation:xrefs-and-link-text.adoc[links], you can do it with images, using both inline and block images.

There is an attribute xref available in image macros, and it accepts the same values as the target of an xref macro, like page ID ou a page fragment.
It will then turn the image into a link to that target.

[#use-image-xref]
== Cross reference on an image to another module

.current-page.adoc
[listing#ex-image-link-across-module-base]
----
image::peak.svg[xref=module:target-resource-filename.ext]
----

The same is possible with inline images.

.current-page.adoc (inline)
[listing#ex-inline-image-link-across-module-base]
----
image:peak.svg[xref=module:target-resource-filename.ext]
----

TIP: It would be possible to point directly to a fragment appending #fragment after the extension of the asciidoc file.
