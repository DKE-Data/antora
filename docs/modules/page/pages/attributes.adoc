Antora and AsciiDoc provide built-in attributes that activate and control syntax output behavior and styles.

== Built-in AsciiDoc attributes

Built-in AsciiDoc attributes are reserved attributes that have special, pre-defined behavior.
Many built-in attributes also have a restricted set of accepted values.
These attributes usually do two things; they toggle a behavior on or off (boolean), and they change the generated output by accepting an alternate value or replacement content (variable).

TIP: If you're not familiar with AsciiDoc attribute restrictions or operations precedence, review the {url-attrs}[attributes section of the Asciidoctor manual^].
