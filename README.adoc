= Antora Direct

Antora is a modular documentation site generator specially designed for users of Asciidoctor.

More specifically, Antora is a modular Asciidoctor documentation toolchain and workflow that empowers technical writing teams to create, manage, collaborate on, remix, and publish documentation sites sourced from a variety of versioned content repositories without needing expertise in web technologies, build automation, or system administration.
This project provides a predefined software pipeline to get started creating documentation sites using Antora quickly.
