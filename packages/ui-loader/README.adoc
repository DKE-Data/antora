= Antora UI Loader

The UI loader is a component in Antora responsible for downloading a UI bundle, if necessary, and loading the files into a UI catalog.
The UI files are combined with the content files at the end of the Antora documentation pipeline to produce a complete site.

https://antora.org[Antora] is a modular static site generator designed for making documentation sites from AsciiDoc aggregated from multiple, versioned content repositories and processed with Asciidoctor.
