= Antora Site Mapper

The site mapper is the component in Antora responsible for generating the sitemap files for the site.
These files, which are intended to be read by crawlers, provide a list of all published pages by URL.
The sitemap entries are partitioned by component into sitemap index files, which are then referenced by the main sitemap file.

https://antora.org[Antora] is a modular static site generator designed for making documentation sites from AsciiDoc aggregated from versioned content repositories and processed with Asciidoctor.
