= Antora Page Composer

The page composer is a component in Antora responsible for wrapping the embeddable HTML contents of each page file in a content catalog in a page layout.
This step yields the standalone HTML pages in the generated site produced by an Antora documentation pipeline.

https://antora.org[Antora] is a modular static site generator designed for creating documentation sites from AsciiDoc documents.
Its site generator pipeline aggregates documents from versioned content repositories and processes them using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor].
