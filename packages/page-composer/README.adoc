= Antora Page Composer

The page composer is a component in Antora responsible for wrapping the embeddable HTML contents of each page file in a content catalog in a page layout.
This step yields the standalone HTML pages in the generated site produced by an Antora documentation pipeline.

https://antora.org[Antora] is a modular static site generator designed for making documentation sites from AsciiDoc aggregated from versioned content repositories and processed with Asciidoctor.
